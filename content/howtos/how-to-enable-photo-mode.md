#### What is Photos Mode? 
'Photos' mode takes a series of images and processes them into a detailed 3d model with real-world scale.
Processing must be done on a compatible Mac Desktop, or on the cloud. 

This how-to covers the Mac desktop companion app, to learn how to enable cloud processing, click here.

**NOTE**
```
Your Mac must meet these requirements to process photo mode scans:
 1. M1 Chip, or  Intel with 16 gb of RAM with AMD GPU with 4 GB VRAM
 2. Running MacOS Monterey ( latest OS )
```

For self-hosted cloud processing options, please contact us at labs@laan.com 

The LiDAR sensor is not required for this mode.

Press the record button to start scanning. 
By default, the app will capture images about every 0.8 seconds. 

Move slowly around the object you want to scan, ensuring that you view it from all sides.

You should aim to capture about 60 - 150 images. 

Tap the record button again to stop capturing

( You can also enable manual capture mode to only take photos when you press the shutter button )

Make sure your iPhone and Mac desktop are on the same WiFi network in order to connect. 

Once you are connected, you can tap "Upload & Process" to start processing images into a 3d Model.

Processing can take a few minutes. You can view the 3d model in the Mac app, or download it back to your device.
