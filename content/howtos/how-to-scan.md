### How to take scans.

In general it's best to move slowly and pan the device around slowly while taking a scan. Quick and jagged movements will affect the quality of the scan. It can take a could passes to figure the best technique for the object or scene you are trying to capture.

To start a scan, press the red button once and again to stop. While there is no set limit on scan time, very large scans may not process well so it's best to take smaller scans and work up to larger one to see the optimal size.

When a scan is complete a texture will be automatically applied, but there are options on the scan detail page to edit the scan, refine it or edit the mesh.
