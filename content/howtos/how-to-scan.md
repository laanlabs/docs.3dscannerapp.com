### How to take scans.

In general it's best to move slowly and pan the device around slowly while taking a scan. Quick and jagged movements will affect the quality of the scan. It can take a could passes to figure the best technique for the object or scene you are trying to capture.

To start a scan, press the red button once and again to stop. While there is no set limit on scan time, very large scans may not process well so it's best to take smaller scans and work up to larger one to see the optimal size.

When a scan is complete a texture will be automatically applied, but there are options on the scan detail page to edit the scan, refine it or edit the mesh.

#### Steps To Scan A Room
1. It is best to start in a corner of of a room with lots of detail (i..e not a white wall)
2. Scanning works best 2-3 Meters (3-9 ft) away from walls and subjects.
3. To start, press the recording button.
4. You will see a grid texture fill in areas that have been captured.
5. Move the phone up and down from floor to ceiling slowly to capture a section like you were rolling on paint with a long roller brush.
6. Move one or two steps at a time around the room and repeat the process filling all areas with the capture texture.
7. Try to only scan an area once. Scanning something over and over may cause issues and will not improve the scan.
8. When you have scanned all room by completing where you started, Tap the record button again to stop.

#### Steps To Scan An Outdoor Area
1. Plan your scan before you start. Though it is possible to take large areas, it is best to work with smaller areas at a time. 10x10 Meters or 30ft x 30ft is a good size to work with.
2. Pick a corner of the area you want to scan.
3. Press the Record Button to start.
4. In a crop-dusting or snake up-down pattern, walk the area slowly moving the scan slowly side to side. Again scanning works best 2-3 Meters (3-9 ft) away. Fill in all areas of the scan without re-scanning the same area if possible. Moving over the same area multiple times can lead to accuracy and drift issues.
5. Make sure to keep the phone pointed at areas with texture. Try not to point the phone above the horizon or at water or another highly reflective surface.
6. When you reach the opposite corner of you scan, press the Record Button to complete the scan.

#### Steps To Scan An Object
1. First consider what you are scanning. Shinny and small objects do not scan well with LiDAR Scans. For example a new bright and shinny car will not make the best scan, but one with dull paint or covered in dust will scan better.
2. Plan your scan before you start. You want to walk around the object and stop where you started so make sure you have a clear path to easily move around your scan subject.
3. To start the scan, press the Record Button.
4. Move slowly around the object panning up and down as you move. Try not to scan the same area twice and make sure detailed texture is always in the scan area. (i.e. do not point at sky while scanning)
5. When you are back to the area you started, press the record button to stop.
