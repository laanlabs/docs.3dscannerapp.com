#### What is Photos Mode? 
'Photos' mode takes a series of images and processes them into a detailed 3d model with real-world scale.
Processing must be done in the cloud, or on a compatible Mac desktop.

The LiDAR sensor is not required for this mode. 


#### Overview 

There are three steps in creating a Photos mode 3d model:
 1. Enable beta access to the Photos mode from iOS 3dScannerApp for iOS 
 2. Capture images using the iOS app 3dScannerApp 
 3. Upload and process images in the cloud

Press the record button to start scanning. 
By default, the app will capture images about every 0.8 seconds. 

Move slowly around the object you want to scan, ensuring that you view it from all sides.

You should aim to capture about 60 - 150 images. 

Tap the record button again to stop capturing

( You can also enable manual capture mode to only take photos when you press the shutter button )

#### 4. Upload and Process Images


Once you've completed capture, tap "Done"

The process screen will pop up, now you must toggle the switch labeled:
"Enable WiFi Transfer"

Make sure your iPhone and Mac desktop are on the same WiFi network in order to connect. 

Once you are connected, you can tap "Upload & Process" to start processing images into a 3d Model.

Processing can take a few minutes. You can view the 3d model in the Mac app, or download it back to your device.
