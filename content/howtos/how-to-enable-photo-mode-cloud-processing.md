#### What is Photos Mode? 
'Photos' mode takes a series of images and processes them into a detailed 3d model with real-world scale.
Processing must be done in the cloud, or on a compatible Mac desktop.

This how-to covers cloud processing, to learn about Mac desktop processing, [click here](/howtos/how-to-enable-photo-mode)

For self-hosted cloud processing options, please email us at labs@laan.com 

The LiDAR sensor is not required for this mode. 


#### Overview 

There are three steps in creating a Photos mode 3d model:
 1. Enable beta access to the Photos mode from iOS 3dScannerApp for iOS 
 2. Capture images using the iOS app 3dScannerApp 
 3. Upload and process images in the cloud

#### 1. Enable beta access to the Photos mode from iOS 3dScannerApp for iOS 

Open 3dScannerApp for iOS, tap 'Scans' from the camera view, then tap the small gear icon in the lower left corner.
Next, scroll down and tap 'Edit Settings' button to show advanced settings. 
Scroll down and find the "Photo Cloud Passcode" text field. 
Enter the code *0777* in the text field.

Now restart the app by force quitting it ( swipe up from bottom of screen and drag 3dScannerApp upwards to remove it )

Once you've enabled Photos mode in the iOS app. 
Open the app and choose 'Photos' scan mode.

Press the record button to start scanning. 
By default, the app will capture images about every 0.8 seconds. 

Move slowly around the object you want to scan, ensuring that you view it from all sides.

You should aim to capture about 60 - 150 images. 

Tap the record button again to stop capturing

( You can also enable manual capture mode to only take photos when you press the shutter button )

#### 3. Upload and Process Images


Once you've completed capture, tap "Done"

The process screen will pop up, tap "Upload & Process" to upload your images.
You must keep the app open during upload. Once processing begins, you may close the app and come back later to check on progress.

Once processing is complete, you can download and view your model.
