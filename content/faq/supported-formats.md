title: What type of 3D files can 3D Scanner Export?
---

### 3D Scanner App Export Formats:

The following 3D Model export formats are available under the share menu from the model view.

* **OBJ** - OBJ format is considered to be a universal 3D model format since it is widely supported by 3D image editing applications. This format usually consists of multiple files with an OBJ, MTL, and JPG Image texture used to render a textured 3D Scene.
* **USDZ** - Developed from Pixar's Universal Scene Description standard, USDZ is a compressed file format that is most widely used by Apple devices.
* **GLTF** - (GL Transmission Format) is an open project by Khronos providing a common, extensible format for 3D assets that are both efficient and highly interoperable with modern web technologies. Another standard format for Android Devices.
* **GLB** - The binary version of the GL Transmission Format (glTF) file, which uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) encoding. So, supporting data (like textures, shaders, and geometry/animation) is contained in a single file. Another standard format for Android Devices.
* **FBX** - FBX (Filmbox) is a proprietary file format ( .fbx ) by Autodesk common in many 3D programs.
* **DAE** -  An open 3D interchange file format used for exchanging digital assets between a variety of graphics programs based on an XML schema.
* **STL** -   STL (STereoLithography) file format is common for CAD applications. STL files do not have photo textures.
* **Point clouds** - A common representation as an alternative to a 3D Mesh commonly used in the GIS, BIM, and architecture Industry. Has a number of specific types that are either binary or ASCII.
    * **XYZ**  - a very simple ASCII format for recording points in 3D space.
    * **PLY** -  an ASCII Polygon Format. 
    * **PTS** -  an ASCII file formatting to store point data typically from LIDAR scanners.
    * **LAS** - LAS is a binary format used specifically for storing LiDAR data
    * **LAS** + geo ref 
    * **E57** - compact, vendor-neutral format for storing point clouds, images, and metadata produced by 3D imaging systems.
    * **PCD** - (Point Cloud Data) file format commonly used with  Point Cloud Library (PCL).
