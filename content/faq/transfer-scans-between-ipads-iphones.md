## How to Transfer Scans Between iPads / iPhones

You can transfer scans between iOS devices. First, ensure both devices have 3DScanner App installed. Then from the source app select the scan you want to share and select "All Data" (make sure the ZIP option is unchecked). Then Share activity view appears, select AirDrop and chose the other device.  On the receiving device, you will be able to select a saving location. Place the received scan folder under the 3DScannerApp directory -
