## How to Transfer Scans Between iPads / iPhones


You can transfer scans wirelessly between iOS devices using AirDrop. 

First, ensure both devices have 3DScanner App installed and are nearby on the same WiFi network with Bluetooth enabled. 

From the source app, open your scan and tap the 'Share' button, then select the "All Data" share option ( make sure the ZIP toggle switch is OFF ). 

The Share activity view will appear, select AirDrop, and choose the other device from the list.

On the receiving device, select 'Files' as save destination if prompted:

Now select the '3d Scanner App' folder under the 'On My iPhone' section to save the scan there.

You can now open 3d Scanner App and the transferred scan should appear in your scans list.
