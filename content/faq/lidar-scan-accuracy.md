### How accurate are LiDAR Scans?

Under ideal conditions, scans with a LiDAR enabled iOS device can be upward of 95% accurate. However this accuracy depends on the condition of the environment, the surfaces being scanned and the techniques used in capturing the scan and, of course, the size of the scan.

It is important to plan your scan in advance to ensure that you are capturing objects and surfaces that scan well. It may take a couple scans to achieve best results.


#### Important Factor: Surface of Scan

Reflective surfaces, such as glass, water, chrome, etc do not scan well and will affect accuracy as well as the content captured. Its best to plan your scan to avoid these surfaces.


#### Important Factor: Size of Scan

A large scan will likely have more error as well as _drift _as the device can lose its position during the scan. 


#### Important Factor: Scan Technique

Scans should be performed slowly and methodically and may require multiple attempts. Please read this [Scan How-To](/howtos/how-to-scan) for recommended techniques.
