### How to Correct Scan Import Scale 

3D Scanner App captures scans in units of 1.0 Meters. Also the app exports in meters so on import you might need to adjust the scale. Most adjustments will be done by a factor of 10. For example SolidWorks imports where a unit of 1.0 = 1.0 Millimeter so the imported model needs to be scaled by a factor 1000 (i.e. 1 Meter = 1000 Millimeters).
