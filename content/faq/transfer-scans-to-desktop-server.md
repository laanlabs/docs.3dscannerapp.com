## How can I transfer a scan to a desktop Mac / PC or server?



### Mac
To share to Mac wirelessly, you can use AirDrop or iCloud drive. 

From 3dScannerApp, open your scan and tap the 'Share' button. 
Select the 3d model format you want from the list, or choose "All Data" to transfer the entire scan ( this folder can be imported into 3dScannerApp on other devices, or backed up for safe keeping. )

To backup all your scans, see below 'Bulk scan backup'


### PC
On a PC we usually recommend using a file cloud service like iCloud (Apple), OneDrive from Microsoft or GDrive from Google. They do charge a subscription fee but a basic plan is usually minimal.

### Bulk Scan Backup ( Mac )
It is possible to backup all of your scans to a Mac desktop at once for safe keeping, or to free up space on your phone. 

First, connect your device to your Mac with a USB / lightning cable. 

Open finder on your Mac, in the finder sidebar, select your iPhone by it's name. ( see image below )

At the top of the Finder window, click Files ( see image )

Now find '3dScannerApp' in the list of your apps and select it.
Then you can select all scans, and drag them to a folder on your Mac. It will take some time to transfer, so leave your phone plugged in.

You can bulk transfer scans back and forth in this manner. ( for example to restore a large backup of scans to a new device )

To transfer a single scan in this way from your phone to Mac, you must find the scan folder name first. 
To find the folder name of a scan from within 3dScannerApp, tap the "More" button in the scan viewer, and select "Scan " ( see images below )

### Transferring one or more Scans from a Mac back to your iPhone
If you have backed up your scans on a desktop, you can restore them to a new phone.
Follow the instructions in the section above 'Bulk Scan Backup ( Mac )'
But drag all of your scans onto the '3dScannerApp' icon within the 'Files' section of Finder.
