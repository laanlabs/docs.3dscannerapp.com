### What is "Extend Scan"
Extend scan feature allows you to add more area to an existing scan at a later date. 

### How to use Extend Scan 
If the extend scan feature is available for your scan, once you tap the extend scan button, you
are brought back to the camera view. Ideally, you should return to the original place where you started this scan 
from in order for automatic alignment to work. 
If alignment is not happening, try walking around a bit to areas of the scan that you are sure you scanned previously
so the app can "remember" what it has already scanned to align with. 


### Why does "Extend Scan" not visible for some scans? 
Extend scan feature relies on capturing enough information during the scan in order to work. 
In some situations, it is not able to capture enough information to allow scan extension. 

Typically, longer scans with lots of textures and features will work best. 
A short scan of only a few seconds, or of a small object may not work. 


<!-- 
#### How can I extend any scan? 
Currently we are beta testing a new feature called 'Projects' mode. 
In this feature, you can import several scans and align them together using a combination of manual and automatic alignment. 

First enable projects mode: 

### Enable Projects Mode

<img style="float: left; margin-left: 30px;" width="230" src="/images/enable-projects-mode.jpg"/>
