### How large of an area or space can be scanned?

Scans do not have a specific size limit, but it is best to limit the scan area to something reasonable to avoid memory and post-processing issues:

Some good recommendations:
* **Rooms**: Limit scans to one or two rooms at a time. Trying to scan a bunch of rooms together may cause multiple issues. Its also best to scan each floor, and stairway separately
* **Outdoor Areas**: 30x30ft or 5x5 Meter blocks work well.

Refer to [How to Scan](/howtos/how-to-scan) for more tips on the scanning process. 

New iPhone and iPads have larger memory and can potentially perform larger scans but because of all the various conditions that go into a scan its difficult to set specific criteria.
