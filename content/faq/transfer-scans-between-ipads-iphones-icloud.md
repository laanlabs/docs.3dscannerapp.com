## How to Transfer Scans Between iPads / iPhones with iCloud 


You can transfer scans wirelessly between iOS devices using iCloud Drive.
You can also share with nearby devices using AirDrop, [read more here](/faq/transfer-scans-between-ipads-iphones)

First, ensure both devices have 3DScanner App installed and share access to the same iCloud drive folders.

From the source app, open your scan and tap the 'Share' button, then select the "All Data" share option ( make sure the ZIP toggle switch is OFF ). 

The Share activity view will appear, select 'Files', and choose the other device from the list.

It can take some time to sync all the data to iCloud. Being on a WiFi network will speed up the transfer. 




On the receiving device, open the 'Files' application by finding it on your home screen, or searching for it:

Locate the folder that you just saved, it will have a name like '2022_02_13_14_56_11' or something. 
You can rename the folder however you like. Or make a new folder to store scans.

Now press and hold on the folder to show the context menu, choose "Copy" or "Move" from the menu:

Now select the '3d Scanner App' folder under the 'On My iPhone' section to move or copy the scan there.

You can now open 3d Scanner App and the transferred scan should appear in your scans list.
